snes9x2010 pak for minui (A30 only)

This core provides an alternative to both SNES cores supplied in MinUI
base+extras.

This will solve the glitches in Yoshi's island, but only just reaches 60fps
on "Normal" CPU setting, so fast forward performance will be poor.

Compared to SUPA core, it uses less cpu overall which should mean less battery
consumed but is more bottlenecked than SUPA as it isn't multi threaded.

Acknowledgement

The binary of this core is from zoltanvb's repository, all I did was put it in 
a pak for MinUI.
