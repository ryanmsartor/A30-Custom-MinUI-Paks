Genesis Plus GX pak for minui (A30 only)

The included Game Gear support in minui uses Picodrive, whose Game Gear support
is incomplete, causing glitching or failures in some games, including adapted
SMS games like Castle of Illusion and Prince of Persia, and original games
like Sonic Triple Trouble.

I tried both Gearsystem and Genesis Plus GX as alternatives.  Gearsystem's
performance requirements are too high to run smoothly in powersave mode whereas
Genesis Plus GX had much lower CPU use.

Note: adapted SMS games like Castle of Illusion and Prince of Persia use their
Master System aspect ratio by default - if you want them stretched 4:3 (as on
the Game Gear) set the scaling accordingly in MinUI's frontend menu.

Acknowledgement

The binary of this core is from zoltanvb's repository, all I did was put it in 
a pak for MinUI.
